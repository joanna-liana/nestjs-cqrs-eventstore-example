[Nest](https://github.com/kamilmysliwiec/nest) framework [CQRS module](https://github.com/kamilmysliwiec/nest-cqrs) usage example.

This project uses a custom EventStoreDB event bus for usage with the CQRS module.

## Setup

To run the project, be sure to spin up the necessary EventStoreDB nodes using:

````
docker-compose up
````

Once EventStoreDB is running, you can start the Nest service. Before the first run, make sure to copy `.env.example` as `.env`.
Next you can start the service with:

```
$ npm start
```

or in the debug mode with:
```
$ npm run start:debug
```

To test the end-to-end flow of the commands, events and sagas, execute the following curl command

```
 curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/hero/1234/kill
```

if everything is setup correctly, you should see the following in the Nest logs:

```
KillDragonCommand...
HeroKilledDragonEvent...
Inside [HeroesGameSagas] Saga
Async DropAncientItemCommand...
Async HeroFoundItemEvent...
```

Its also a good idea to inspect the message queue to ensure the necessary events have been
sent. This can be done using the Event Store's Stream Browser that spins up as part of the Docker Compose:

````
http://localhost:2113/web/index.html#/streams/hero-stream
````
